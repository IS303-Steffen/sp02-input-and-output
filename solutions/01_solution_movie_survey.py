OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You are helping run a movie research survey. You want to gather a few
details from the user and display them back in a formatted message.

1. Ask the user for their name using input().
2. Ask the user for their favorite movie using input().
3. Print out a sentence like: "Nice to meet you, <name>! <movie> is a great
   choice!"
'''

# Here is one potential solution. Remember there are often many different
# ways to solve a problem, so your solution may not look exactly the same.

name = input("What is your name? ")
movie = input("What is your favorite movie? ")

print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}! {movie} is a great choice!")

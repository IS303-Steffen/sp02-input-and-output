OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You are making a little survey tool to gather snack preferences. You want
to get two pieces of information from the user and include them in a short
message using input() and string concatenation.

1. Ask the user what their favorite snack is.
2. Ask the user how many times a week they eat it.
3. Print a message like: "You eat <snack> <times> times a week? Yum!"
